## How to use

**TL;DR: Your first step should be to check out the app subdirectory in this repo that you are interested in, and follow the instructions in that subdirectory's `code/readme.md` file.**

This repo contains multiple example apps. Each subdirectory in the repo contains an example app that accompanies an Android developer guide on [creativesdk.com](http://creativesdk.com).

The instructions for setting up each app can be found in the readme in its `/code` subdirectory. The subdirectory readmes also contain links to their respective developer guides, where you can get step-by-step instructions for creating the apps.
