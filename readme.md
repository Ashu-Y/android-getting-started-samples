# Android: Getting Started Samples

This repo will contain Getting Started sample apps to accompany the Android developer guides on [creativesdk.com](http://creativesdk.com).

Stay tuned for updates as we build out this library of samples!

## How to use

This repo contains multiple example apps. Each subdirectory is an example app that accompanies an Android developer guide on [creativesdk.com](http://creativesdk.com).

The instructions for setting up each app can be found in the readme in its subdirectory. The subdirectory readmes also contain links to their respective developer guides, where you can get step-by-step instructions for creating the apps.

**Your first step should be to check out the app subdirectory that you are interested in, and follow the instructions in that subdirectory's readme.**
